## Installation

1. cd into frontend folder and install dependencies with `pnpm install`
2. Run the app with `pnpm run dev` to start 

TODO:

- Go back and finish the styling and structure of the landing page once I've finished implementing the table functionality.

- Now that I've installed Tailwind and Daisy UI, some of the styling in the module.css files will be redundant so those need to be tidied up.
